					Cornerstone Volunteer Group is a non-profit organization that aims to help students and immigrants to find fitting volunteering opportunities for them so these people have an easier time fitting into Saskatoon society and can understand local Saskatoon culture.  The Cornerstone Volunteer Group is formed in March, 2016 currently consists of 20 student volunteers.  In the near future, we plan to invite professionals from different professions to talk about possible future developments in the field, interviewing techniques, and different company cultures.  At the same time, we will be providing recommendation letters to volunteers with outstanding performances to support them in their jobs and internship applications.  Cornerstone is currently working with the  Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation, and LutherCare Communities, and we hope to developing further partnership with other organizations in Saskatoon.
